    <h2>I'm a Web-Developer</h2>
    <h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at SRM Chennai. With
      a solid foundation in Python, HTML, SQL, and CSS, I am passionate about
      web development and constantly expanding my skills. In addition to my
      technical expertise, I am a karate black belt, which has taught me
      discipline and perseverance. I was also an active member of my school's
      student council, where I developed leadership and teamwork abilities. My
      diverse experiences, both academically and personally, drive me to excel
      in everything I do..
